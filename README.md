### Research Paper
1. Deep Learning-Powered Prediction of Human-Virus Protein-Protein Interactions(Dec-2021):<br/>
<pre>
	Negative sampling: Dissimilarity-Based Negative Sampling(A->B , B->C then A and C cannot be negative sample)
	Dataset imabalalance recommended to replicate real world scenario: 1:10 (has been proven reasonable to predict PPI)

### Database Information
1. HPIDB 2.0: 45,238 manually curated entries PPI
2. HVIDB: 48,643 experimentally verified human–virus PPIs covering 35 virus families, 6633 virally targeted host complexes, 3572 host
dependency/restriction factors as well as 911 experimentally verified/predicted 3D complex structures of human–virus PPIs.
Furthermore, our database resource provides tissue-specific expression profiles of 6790 human genes that are targeted by
viruses and 129 Gene Expression Omnibus series of differentially expressed genes post-viral infections(Collected)
